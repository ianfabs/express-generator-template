Express Generator templates

I made this for people who can't use express-generator on their current workstation 
(domain restrictions, and such)

If you have other issues using the command prompt in your networks domain due to restrictions,
I highly reccomend [cmder](http://cmder.net/) ( [their github](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder) )
even if you do have access to the regular terminal, I use it as my default shell now

also [PortableApps.com](http://portableapps.com/download) is a great tool for situations like that as well
